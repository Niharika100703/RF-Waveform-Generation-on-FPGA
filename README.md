FPGA-based RF Signal Generation and Modulation

Project Overview
This project focuses on the generation and modulation of RF signals using an FPGA. 
The design is implemented using various IP cores such as BRAM, DDS, and a Complex Multiplier. 
The primary aim is to generate RF signals of the form cos(wt + mt) by integrating different components within an FPGA design flow.
